## Warnings:
### WCER-W1
**Warning, Extension Reloader Plugin was not enabled! It runs only on webpack --mode=development (v4 or more) or with NODE_ENV=development (lower versions)**.  

This means that the webpack **[option.mode](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/mode/)** isn't "_development_", and the plugin will not be included on the building process. On older versions than v4, use this value on the environment variable **NODE_ENV**.
To not see this warning, make sure to not add this plugin on a non development build, on your Webpack configuration.

## Errors:
### WCER-E1
**Background script entry is required.** . 

The error is raised whenever no _background script_ is provided through the plugin options.
Without the background script, Webpack Extension reloader is unable to access the extension lifecycle through the [browser.runtime](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime) to execute the proper hot reload.
```js
entry: {
    //...
    background: './background.js' // *This is required
},
//...
plugins: [
    new ExtensionReloader({
      //...
      entries: { 
        // ...
        background: 'background' // *This is required
      }
    })
]
```
If your **extension don't have background script**, at least provide an empty `background.js` on both manifest.json and Webpack plugin config, on **development mode**.
